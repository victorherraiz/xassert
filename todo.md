  * includes
  * isFulfilledWith
  * isNotDeepEqual
  * isRejectedWith
  * mayHaveAProperty
  * satisfiesAnyOf
  * itDoesNotHaveAnyOtherPropertyApartFrom
  * isDeeplyFrozen
* Test messages (for properties)
* review all texts
* Assertions can be disconnected
* Is satisfies function necessary?
* Every should have a message and capture the exception?
* test that isFulfilled return always the value
* Create helper method to create custom assertions (e.g.: `matcher(it => it.isAString()`)
* document fire as protected or public and add example in readme
